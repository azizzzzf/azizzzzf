# Hello, I'm Aziz 👋

At the intersection of **technology**, **mathematics**, and **philosophy**, I work to design systems that are not only functional but meaningful. My background in software engineering gives me the tools to build, math sharpens the reason to structure solutions, and philosophy helps me see through different lenses—to think about technology not just as tools, but as something that shapes society, values, and even human identity.

## 🚀 Current Role

I currently serve as **Co-founder and CTO of Heepo**, a company I co-founded to help businesses grow and scale through AI-powered automation and scalable applications. At Heepo, we build solutions that:
- Streamline operations
- Optimize decision making  
- Unlock efficiency through intelligent systems

## 💼 What I Build

I have built systems that organizations rely on every day:

**🏢 Enterprise Solutions**
- Employee management platforms to streamline operations
- Payroll automation tools that ensure accuracy at scale
- Employee identity recognition systems bringing advanced AI into real-world use cases

**🤖 AI & Computer Vision**
My work in computer vision is driven by a focus on how intelligent systems can be deployed reliably in dynamic environments, bridging the gap between research and practical application.

## 🎯 Philosophy & Approach

Beyond writing code, I see every system as part of a broader narrative—one where design choices carry consequences and innovation reflects human priorities. What drives me is:

- **Clarity in problem-solving** - Finding elegant solutions to complex challenges
- **Building with purpose** - Creating systems that serve real human needs
- **Conscious innovation** - Understanding that every solution shapes how people live and work

## 🌟 Mission

My journey is about **building with intention**: creating systems that are reliable, adaptable, and human-centered. Not just code that executes, but solutions that endure and make a difference.
